The first bug was from developing the timer for tiles drying
initally I was trying to make the x variable double every time
however I had tried to account for a displacement which didnt exist

The second bug is similar to the first
ironically after i reverted the change and did a few more changes the displacement which was not there before was now there
after this i decided to just revert the changes and just use 2 * x and 2 * x + 1 which is still in the current code

The third bug was simply caused by me forgeting to crop and resize the texture for watered seedlings

The fourth bug was like the previous instance but for fully grown crops
